# sei-it-right

My first web app using React. A simple 'speed-dating' game. Made to improve my conversational Samoan. The initial version is limited. Hopefully, I will revisit the game with more dynamic dialogue and animated characters. 

This repo doesn't have all the files from the folder - node_modules and other files that appear when a react project is created. Best to create a react project and replace the src folder and index.html with the attached.
